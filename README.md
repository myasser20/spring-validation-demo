This project demonstrates how to implement validation in a Spring Boot application. It provides a basic example of validating user input data to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
Key Features:
- Form Validation: Validates user input data submitted through a form, such as:
    Required fields
    Data type constraints (e.g., email, number, date)
    Length restrictions
    Custom validation rules
- Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages to the user when validation fails.
